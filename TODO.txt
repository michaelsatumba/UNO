CURRENT NOTES:
    - Look into way to show who's turn it is?

GAME LOGIC:
    - (FOR LATER) Fix weird double click to do most interactions?
        - Rarely is one click for interactions (i.e. clicking card to play)
        - NEW: Have to click again or refresh the page for updated game state after interaction
    - Indicate who's turn it is
        - Text Box with log of commands on screen?
        - OR Text Box that updates who's turn it is
    - WIN CONDITION:
        - When a player has no more cards
        - End the game
            - (DONE-ish?) Stop updating gameState?
                - Safely disable Draw button (or remove?)
            - Post an alert or message on screen as to who won?
    - (OPTIONAL) Two or Three players can play??
        - Once two players are in, game can start?
        - During game, more players up to MAX PLAYERS (4) can join?
    - (OPTIONAL) CALL UNO! feature
        - Checks if user is in game, check if its user's turn
        - Checks if user has two cards (about to play a card)
        - Displays message to socket that user has called Uno??
        - Check on next player's turn to call out previous player's not calling Uno
            - If correct, give previous player 4 cards?

LOGIN:
    - Incorrect login currently redirects to /users/login empty empty page 
    - FIX this to display error messages (i.e. account doesn't exist, wrong passwd, etc.)

DESIGN:
    - Look into upgrading site designs!
