      <h1>Object of the game</h1>
      <p>The first player to have one card and clicks "Uno" wins.</p>
      <h1>Gameplay</h1>
      <p>Each player is dealt 7 cards. Turn over the top card of the draw pile to begin a discard pile.</p>
      <p>Player to the left of the dealer plays first. Play passes to the left to start. Match the top card on the DISCARD pile either by number, color or word.</p>
      <p>For example, if the card is a Green 7, you must play a Green card or any color 7. Or, you may play any Wild card or a Wild Draw 4 card. If you don't have anything that matches, you must pick a card from the DRAW pile. If you draw a card you can play, play it.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, play moves to the next person. Before playing your next to last card, you must say "UNO". If you don't say UNO and another player catches you with just one card before the next player begins their turn you must pick FOUR more cards from the DRAW pile.</p>
      <p>If you are not caught before the next player either draws a card from the DRAW pile or draws a card from their hand to play, you do not have to draw the extra cards. Once a player plays their last card, the hand is over.</p>
